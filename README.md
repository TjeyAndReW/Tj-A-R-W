Main repository

Hi! I'm 22, and I'm a very new in programming. 
Right now my main task is create a good site for my mother. Probably I'll use WordPress CMS, becouse she wants blog-site.

Here in this repository I'll publish my code (php, html5 and other web-programming languages), and sometimes C++ code for my studying (maybe not only for studying :) )
